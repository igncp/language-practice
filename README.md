# Language Practice

These are some personal notes, scripts, and exercises to keep practicing and
learning languages, organize learning resources, and to not lose the existing knowledge.

My target is to dedicate at least two hours per day, resting from time to time.
They consist of texts where I practice writing for topics like tones, pinyin,
grammar, etc. It also contains links to common setup and vocabulary lists for
multiple applications.

The repository is made public in case it can give an idea to others for how to
practice language learning daily, or the tools to use for these languages.
