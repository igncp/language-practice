# Language Practice

These are some personal notes, scripts, and exercises to keep practicing and learning languages to not lose the existing knowledge.

My target is to dedicate at least two hours per day, resting from time to time. They consist of texts where I practice writing for topics like tones, pinyin, grammar, etc. It also contains links to common setup and vocabulary lists for multiple applications.
