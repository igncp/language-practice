# The 100x100 Challenge

This is a project to write subtitles with at least 100 lines per day for 100
days. The videos don't need to be finished but every day it has to be the same
one (unless finished on that day).

Unlike the `50x50` challenge, each line needs to have at least 10 chinese
characters.
